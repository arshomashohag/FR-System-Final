## Fashion Recommender System
Fashion Recommender(FR) System is a Recommender engine for recommending fashion products based on visual similarity.

## Prerequisites
You need Python 3, Tensorflow, Keras and more tools/ packages.
Check requirements.txt file for the whole list of required tools and packages.

## Installation
Use run.sh script to run the application.
./run.sh

## Built With
1. TensorFlow 1.4
2. Keras 2.3
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Anaconda 3
6. PyCharm Community Edition IDE

## Features
1. It recommends similar fashion items based on visual similarity for known inventory fashion items.
2. It can also recommend similar fashion items for new/unknown items against inventory items.

## Usage
It can used in e-commerce site to recommend fashion products those are visually similar.
APIs of Recommender engine can be used to serve this purpose.

## Contributing
It further can be improved by BJIt engineers.
